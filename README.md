# Conditional Self-Supervised Learning on Gameplay Data
An action-conditioned autoencoder in the context of the Industrial Master's Project with Sony. 

The U-Net autoencoder receives an input of gameplay frames and controller actions, and depending on its configuration outputs either interpolated or future frames, using actions to anticipate the player's motion.

The model outputs images of high perceptual quality, comparable to ground truth images for even 4 consecutive frames.
